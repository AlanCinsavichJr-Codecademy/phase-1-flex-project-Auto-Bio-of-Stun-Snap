<h1>The Short Autobiography of the Career of the Photography know as Stunning Snapshots</h1>
</header>
<div id = "Introduction">
    <p>When a person goes through schcool they are encouraged by their family, teacheers, coaches, counselors and various other people to find their nichie or unique talent that can promise a long successful career for life </p>
    <p>"Oh but how, where, and even why should I find a talent that is partciular interest to me?" A peron might ask.</p>
    <p>Answers to those questions ususally come from their time in high school where oppurtunties are avalialbe for people to immerse themselves in lilke sports, music, theater, charity work and the list can go on.</p>
    <p>For me it all started my senior year during those special times we're all supposed to chersih as treasured memories; spirit week, homecoming and prom. </p>
    <p>In high shool I had two unique talents that made me stand out; impersonations and photography.</p>
    <p>During those special cherised memory times you would always find me with a camera in my hands.</p>
    <p>When it came to prom, I remember telling my friends that my date was my camera.</p>
    <p>So now let's fast forward. I am in college trying to study for major I like but not getting really any clear direction as to a career.</p>
    <p>Where do I go from here? I know I need to make a living so why not fall back on a talent on which I already saw success in?</p>
    <p>So from that point on, whenever I could usually on family vacations or photography workshop that involved beautiful models I would self teach and gain starter experience for my first career.</p>

    <p>When I was growing up I had fond memories from times where my dad would show off his early polaroid photos with a slide projector, the cold night when he set up a camera to take pictures of the commet Halle Bopp, and when my mother would take me to get camera film developed.</p>
    <p>Then came the era of cell phone cameras and Instagram. Thanks to stuck up celebrities who think they know everything, everyone got the idea they could be the next Ansel Adams.</p>
    <p>I am a Firm Believer in that Photography is an Art and like any art form you need passion, talent and skills to be any good.</p>
    <p>Anyone can push a button a phone screen and take a picture. </p>
    <p>I didn't want to be like everyone else with a phone camera, I wanted to stand out professionally.</p>
    <p>So I picked up my camera and looked for any unique oppurtunties to take pictures.</p>
    <p>I already had one thing going for me when it came to exotic photos.</p>
    <p>Ever since I was little my Father would usually take my family to great vacation hotspots wether they would be domestic or overseas.</p>
    <p>And when I was old enough I always would have a camera in my hand taking pictures of every moment whhile on vacation.</p>
    <p>Then while studying in college, I got the chance to start attending model workshops.</p>
    <p>From point on the rest as the saying goes is history.</p>
